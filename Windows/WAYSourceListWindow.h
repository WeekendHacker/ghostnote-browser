/** The WAYSourceListWindow is a NSWindow subclass, which splits the window space vertically into the master view on the left, and the detail view on the right side as known from apps like Reminders or Notes. The window uses a NSSplitView for the splitting. You should add subviews to instances of this class by setting the masterView and detailView. These views will then be added internally to the masterViewWrapper or detailViewWrapper.
